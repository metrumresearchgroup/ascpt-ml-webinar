Create the formatted datasets for training and testing in a format for xgboost, which is a matrix. 
Also, the recipes package is used to preprocess categorical and ordinal covariates into numerics for xgboost.

```{R}

# This is like specifying a model, but for data pre-proecessing 
recipe_xgboost <- recipes::recipe(class_n ~ age_f + menopause + tumor_size_f + inv_nodes_f + node_caps + deg_malig + breast + breast_quad + irradiat, 
                data = training(init_split)) %>%
  step_ordinalscore(age_f, tumor_size_f, inv_nodes_f) %>%
  step_dummy(breast, breast_quad, irradiat, menopause, node_caps, one_hot = T)

# This is like fitting the model 
estimated_preprocessing <- prep(recipe_xgboost, training(init_split))

# This is like using the model to make predictions
# There will be warnings about new factor levels, in this case for xgboost we can ignore them
# Also, y is a logical vector, so the "pull" function is used
x_train <- bake(estimated_preprocessing, training(init_split), -class_n, composition = "matrix")
y_train <- bake(estimated_preprocessing, training(init_split)) %>% pull(class_n) 

x_test <- bake(estimated_preprocessing, testing(init_split), -class_n, composition = "matrix")
y_test <- bake(estimated_preprocessing, testing(init_split)) %>% pull(class_n) 

```

Fit the model with default tuning parameters. 

```{R}

fit1 <- xgboost::xgboost(data = x_train, 
                         label = y_train,
                         nrounds = 15,
                         params = list(
                           objective = "binary:logistic"
                         ))

```

Evaluate fit

```{R}

# Using the test set here, which was not used to fit the model
predictions <- testing(init_split) %>%
  mutate(pred_pr = predict(fit1, x_test))

# ROC curves are a common way to assess a binary prediction
predictions %>%
  mutate(truth = Class) %>%
  roc_auc(pred_pr, truth = truth, estimator = "binary", event_level = "first")

# Confusion matrix for predictions
predictions %>%
  mutate(truth = Class,
         pred = factor(if_else(pred_pr >= 0.5, "no-recurrence-events", "recurrence-events", ),  levels = c("recurrence-events", "no-recurrence-events"))) %>%
  yardstick::conf_mat(estimate = pred, truth = truth)

# The yardstick package has many functions to evaluate (and plot evaluation) of models, and works in the tidymodels package

```

## Model interpretation with Shapley Values


```{R}

# Note the shapley values are for predicting the first class in the Class factor, which is no recurrence events
# Always good to pay attention to how R and libraries are using factor orderings
shap_plot <- xgb.ggplot.shap.summary(data = bake(extract_recipe(final_fit), testing(init_split)) %>% select(-Class) %>% as.matrix(),
                        model = extract_fit_parsnip(final_fit)$fit) +
  labs(x = "Shapley Value", color = "Feature Value") 

shap_plot



```

Sanity check the shapley predictions by making predictions for two different values of tumor sizes for one set of covariate values

```{R}

# Create a dataset of covariates to make predictions
x_predict <- testing(init_split)[1,] %>%
  select(-tumor_size_f) %>%
  dplyr::inner_join(tibble(tumor_size_f = c("0-4", "50-54")), by = character())


# Make the predictions
predict(extract_workflow(final_fit),
        new_data = x_predict,
        type = "prob")
```
